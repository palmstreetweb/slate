# Architecture Decision Log

ADR-style log. Every non-trivial architectural choice gets an entry. Format:

```
## ADR-NNN — Title
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: accepted | superseded | deferred
Context: why we needed to choose
Decision: what we chose
Alternatives: what else we considered
Consequences: trade-offs we're accepting
Revisit when: a concrete trigger

## ADR-001 — Package name and scope
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: This library is internal Palm Street Web tooling, used across multiple client projects (805 Sealcoating, Wallace Plumbing, Wild Wash, PSW v2). It is not open-source. It needs to live in the private `@palmstreetweb` npm scope.
Decision: Publish as `@palmstreetweb/forms` with `publishConfig.access = "restricted"`. License: `UNLICENSED` (proprietary).
Alternatives:
- Open-source as `psw-forms` on the public registry. Rejected — clients pay for bespoke work; the library encodes agency IP (theme system, UX patterns).
- Multi-package monorepo with `@palmstreetweb/forms-core`, `@palmstreetweb/forms-themes`, etc. Rejected for v1 — premature optimization for a one-package library.
Consequences:
- Consumers need npm auth to the `@palmstreetweb` org.
- We can't expect community contributions; the agency owns all work.
Revisit when: we ship a second package under the scope, or considering open-sourcing.

## ADR-002 — Bundler: tsup
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: We need ESM + CJS + `.d.ts` emit with React JSX support. Tree-shaking matters because the engine targets <50kb gzipped (brief §2.9).
Decision: Use `tsup` for the library build. Use `vite` separately as the dev server for `examples/` and as the test runner via Vitest.
Alternatives:
- Vite library mode. Functional but heavier config for a pure library output; tsup is purpose-built for this and zero-config.
- Rollup directly. Too much boilerplate for our needs.
- esbuild only. Doesn't emit `.d.ts` cleanly without a wrapper.
Consequences:
- Two configs (tsup for build, vite for dev/test). Slightly more files but each is small and serves a clear purpose.
- tsup's CSS handling is basic — we use `loader: { '.css': 'copy' }` and expect consumers to import `@palmstreetweb/forms/styles.css` explicitly.
Revisit when: tsup falls behind on JSX/RSC support, or we need fine-grained Rollup plugin control.

## ADR-003 — localStorage key
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: The PSW site itself uses `psw-theme` for its theme persistence (palmstreetweb.com). If our forms package writes to the same key while embedded on PSW's site, we collide.
Decision: Use `psw-forms-theme` as the localStorage key.
Alternatives:
- Share `psw-theme` with the host. Rejected — embedded forms shouldn't mutate the host's theme state.
- Scope per-form (`psw-forms-theme:<schema-id>`). Rejected — over-engineered; a user toggling once should persist across all forms they encounter on a site.
Consequences:
- On first mount we read `document.documentElement.dataset.theme` (the host's current theme) as a fallback if our own key is unset — this gives the right initial state without us writing to the host's key.
Revisit when: a consumer reports cross-form theme desync.

## ADR-004 — `data-theme` lives on the wrapper, not `<html>`
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: The package is embedded in someone else's page. We can't assume we own `<html>`. The host page may already have its own theme system reading `<html data-theme>`.
Decision: Apply `data-theme="light|dark"` to the `[data-psw-forms]` wrapper element rendered by `<Form>`. Token CSS is scoped via `[data-psw-forms][data-theme="light"] { ... }`. We **read** `<html>.dataset.theme` on first mount for inheritance; we **never write** to it.
Alternatives:
- Write to `<html>` (PSW's own pattern). Rejected — host page collision.
- Shadow DOM. Rejected for v1 — complicates font loading and breaks tab order with the rest of the page.
Consequences:
- Slightly heavier selectors (extra `[data-psw-forms]` prefix on every token override).
- Host pages can still influence us on first mount via their own `<html data-theme>`.
Revisit when: a consumer needs to embed multiple `<Form>` instances on a single page with different themes (currently supported, but verify when it happens).

## ADR-005 — Conditional logic retention semantics
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: A question with `visibleIf` may become hidden mid-flow after a prior answer changes. What should happen to its already-collected answer?
Decision: **Retain answers in internal state, exclude from `onSubmit` payload.** If the user toggles the prior answer back and the question becomes visible again, their previously-typed answer is still there. But the `onSubmit` `answers` object only contains values for questions whose `visibleIf` evaluates true at submit time.
Alternatives:
- Delete on hide. Rejected — frustrating UX if the user toggles back and forth.
- Always include in `onSubmit` regardless of visibility. Rejected — pollutes the payload with stale data from abandoned branches.
Consequences:
- The engine maintains a distinction between "all answers" (internal) and "visible answers" (the `Answers` object passed to `onSubmit`).
- `SubmitMeta.questionsVisited` is the ordered list of question IDs actually shown — this is the consumer's audit trail for which branch was traversed.
Revisit when: a consumer needs the full unfiltered state (e.g., for resume-from-URL — currently V2).

## ADR-006 — Phone validation via `libphonenumber-js`, lazy-imported
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: Brief §2.9 mandates "zero runtime dependencies beyond React" but §5 requires E.164 normalization via `libphonenumber-js` for `phone` questions. Direct conflict.
Decision: Add `libphonenumber-js` as a runtime dependency, **lazy-imported only inside `src/components/questions/PhoneField.tsx`** via dynamic `import()`. Consumers who never use `phone` questions don't pay for it — tree-shaking + code-splitting keep the engine bundle clean.
Alternatives:
- Ship a homegrown regex validator. Rejected — phone-number normalization is an underestimated swamp; getting it wrong leaks bad data into CRMs.
- Make it a peer dependency. Rejected — consumers shouldn't have to know about our internals to install a quote form.
- Defer `phone` type to V2. Rejected — quote forms need phone numbers; that's table stakes.
Consequences:
- Total dep count: 1 runtime dep.
- `PhoneField.tsx` does `const { parsePhoneNumber } = await import('libphonenumber-js')` inside its handler, so the ~16kb is only paid when a phone question renders.
- Bundle budget audit: engine still <50kb gzipped without `libphonenumber-js` because it's tree-shaken out of `import { Form } from '@palmstreetweb/forms'` when no schema contains a phone question.
Revisit when: bundle audits show `libphonenumber-js` is being eagerly bundled, or a viable lightweight alternative emerges.

## ADR-007 — Version: `1.0.0-beta.1`
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: Golden-prompt instructions said `1.0.0-beta.0`, but brief §13 and §16 say `1.0.0-beta.1`. Picking one.
Decision: Ship as `1.0.0-beta.1`. The brief is canonical.
Alternatives: `1.0.0-beta.0` (golden prompt). Rejected — the brief was written first and reviewed twice; the golden prompt typo lost.
Consequences: First publish is `1.0.0-beta.1`. Subsequent betas increment from there. Promote to `1.0.0` after dogfooding on Wild Wash per brief §16.
Revisit when: betas wrap and we promote to `1.0.0`.

## ADR-008 — Single vite config drives both dev server and tests
Date: 2026-05-10
Status: accepted
Context: We need a dev server for `examples/` (`npm run dev`) and a Vitest config with React + jsdom. Vite is the common base for both.
Decision: Keep them separate (`vite.config.ts` for the dev server with `root: 'examples'`; `vitest.config.ts` for tests). Both share the `@/*` alias for parity.
Alternatives:
- Single config with `test:` block. Rejected — `root: 'examples'` confuses Vitest's path resolution.
Consequences: Two small configs. Each is ~15 lines.
Revisit when: dual-maintenance burden becomes annoying (unlikely at this size).

## Deferred to V2

Per brief §14, V1 explicitly does **not** include the items below. Each gets a stub ADR when the work is actually scheduled.

- **File upload question type** — needs storage strategy decision (presigned URLs vs. direct multipart).
- **Date picker question type** — large surface area; punt until a real consumer needs it.
- **Calculator / scoring logic** — opens the door to a full expression language; out of scope.
- **Save-and-resume from URL token** — needs a signing strategy.
- **iframe / HTML script-tag embed** — different consumer model; current package is React-only.
- **Built-in analytics event bus** — `onQuestionChange` callback is enough for V1.
- **Translation / i18n** — current pattern: callers pass already-localized strings.
- **Visual form builder UI** — agency writes schemas in code; clients never edit forms directly.
- **Multi-tenant form storage backend** — out of package scope.
- **Client-facing admin dashboard** — out of package scope.
